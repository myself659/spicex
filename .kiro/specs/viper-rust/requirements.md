# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a Rust version of Viper, a complete configuration solution for Go applications. Viper is designed to work within an application and can handle all types of configuration needs and formats. The Rust implementation will provide similar functionality, allowing developers to easily manage configuration from various sources including files, environment variables, command line flags, and remote key/value stores.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Rust developer, I want to read configuration from multiple file formats (JSON, YAML, TOML, INI, HCL, envfile, Java properties), so that I can use my preferred configuration format without changing my application code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a configuration file is provided in JSON format THEN the system SHALL parse and load the configuration values
2. WHEN a configuration file is provided in YAML format THEN the system SHALL parse and load the configuration values
3. WHEN a configuration file is provided in TOML format THEN the system SHALL parse and load the configuration values
4. WHEN a configuration file is provided in INI format THEN the system SHALL parse and load the configuration values
5. WHEN a configuration file is provided in HCL format THEN the system SHALL parse and load the configuration values
6. WHEN a configuration file is provided in envfile format THEN the system SHALL parse and load the configuration values
7. WHEN a configuration file is provided in Java properties format THEN the system SHALL parse and load the configuration values
8. WHEN an unsupported file format is provided THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set default values for configuration keys, so that my application has sensible fallbacks when specific configuration is not provided.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a default value is set for a configuration key THEN the system SHALL return the default value if no other value is found
2. WHEN multiple sources provide values for the same key THEN the system SHALL follow the precedence order and override defaults
3. WHEN a default value is set after other values are loaded THEN the system SHALL not override existing values

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to read configuration values from environment variables, so that I can configure my application through the deployment environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an environment variable exists with a matching key THEN the system SHALL return the environment variable value
2. WHEN environment variable names use different casing or separators THEN the system SHALL support automatic key transformation
3. WHEN a prefix is set for environment variables THEN the system SHALL only consider variables with that prefix
4. WHEN environment variables contain nested structures THEN the system SHALL support delimiter-based nesting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to read configuration from command line flags, so that users can override configuration at runtime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN command line flags are provided THEN the system SHALL parse and use those values
2. WHEN both short and long flag formats are used THEN the system SHALL support both formats
3. WHEN flag values conflict with other sources THEN command line flags SHALL take precedence
4. WHEN invalid flags are provided THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configuration values to follow a precedence order, so that I can predictably override settings from different sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple sources provide the same configuration key THEN the system SHALL follow this precedence: explicit calls > flags > env vars > config file > key/value store > defaults
2. WHEN a higher precedence source provides a value THEN the system SHALL use that value regardless of lower precedence sources
3. WHEN a configuration source is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to the next available source in precedence order

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to watch configuration files for changes, so that my application can react to configuration updates without restart.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a configuration file is modified THEN the system SHALL detect the change
2. WHEN file changes are detected THEN the system SHALL reload the configuration automatically
3. WHEN configuration reload fails THEN the system SHALL maintain the previous valid configuration
4. WHEN file watching is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide callbacks for configuration change events

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access nested configuration values using dot notation, so that I can easily retrieve values from complex configuration structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a nested configuration key is requested using dot notation THEN the system SHALL return the correct nested value
2. WHEN a nested key does not exist THEN the system SHALL return None or a default value
3. WHEN configuration contains arrays THEN the system SHALL support index-based access
4. WHEN key names contain special characters THEN the system SHALL handle them appropriately

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to unmarshal configuration into Rust structs, so that I can work with strongly-typed configuration objects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a struct implements the appropriate traits THEN the system SHALL deserialize configuration into that struct
2. WHEN struct fields don't match configuration keys THEN the system SHALL support field renaming through attributes
3. WHEN deserialization fails due to type mismatch THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
4. WHEN optional fields are missing from configuration THEN the system SHALL use default values or None

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to write configuration back to files, so that I can persist configuration changes made at runtime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration values are modified THEN the system SHALL support writing changes back to the original file format
2. WHEN the target file format doesn't support all data types THEN the system SHALL handle conversion appropriately
3. WHEN write operations fail THEN the system SHALL return descriptive error messages
4. WHEN file permissions prevent writing THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to search for configuration files in multiple locations, so that I can follow standard configuration file conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no explicit config file path is provided THEN the system SHALL search in standard locations (current directory, home directory, system config directories)
2. WHEN multiple config files exist in search paths THEN the system SHALL use the first one found or merge them based on configuration
3. WHEN no config file is found in search paths THEN the system SHALL continue with other configuration sources
4. WHEN custom search paths are specified THEN the system SHALL search those paths in addition to or instead of defaults
